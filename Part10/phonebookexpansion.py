    Phone Book Application

    This program implements a simple text-based phone book application. It allows users
    to add new contacts, search for numbers by name, and save or load data from a file
    automatically. The application is organized into three main classes:

    - PhoneBook: handles storage and lookup of names and numbers.
    - FileHandler: manages reading and writing phone book data to a file.
    - PhoneBookApplication: provides a command-line user interface.

    Note:
    The overall structure and functionality of the code were provided as part of an exercise
    template. Only the "search by number" feature (the method `get_name_by_num()` in PhoneBook and 
    `search_by_num()` in PhoneBookApplication) were implemented by me.
