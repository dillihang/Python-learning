Python + Automation + DevOps Roadmap (3–6 months)
=================================================

Phase 1: Core Python Reinforcement (Weeks 1–3)
----------------------------------------------
Goal: Strengthen Python fundamentals and OOP for practical scripting.

Focus Areas:
- Functions, modules, and packages
- File I/O: text, CSV, JSON, YAML
- Error handling: try/except, raising exceptions
- Classes & OOP: inheritance, composition, magic methods
- Iterators, generators, decorators, context managers

Exercises:
- Recreate MOOC exercises from memory.
- Write a “utility library”:
    - File operations
    - Text/CSV parsing
    - Logging helpers
- Small OOP practice: library management system or bank account system using classes.

Mini-Project:
- File organizer: Move files from Downloads into folders based on file type.

Phase 2: Automation Basics (Weeks 4–6)
--------------------------------------
Goal: Use Python to automate everyday tasks.

Focus Areas:
- os, shutil, pathlib for filesystem automation
- Scheduling: schedule library or cron jobs
- Working with APIs: requests + JSON
- Web scraping basics: BeautifulSoup
- Excel/CSV automation: pandas, openpyxl

Exercises:
- Parse CSV data and summarize it.
- Scrape a website and store results in a CSV.
- Practice API requests (GitHub API, weather API, etc.).

Mini-Project:
- Daily report bot: Collect data from a website/API, save to CSV, optionally send an email.
- Batch Excel automation: Update multiple Excel sheets with new data automatically.

Phase 3: Advanced Automation & DevOps (Weeks 7–10)
--------------------------------------------------
Goal: Python scripting applied to DevOps and system tasks.

Focus Areas:
- subprocess to run shell commands
- Automating Docker: build/run containers
- Monitoring & logging: CPU, memory, disk usage
- Config scripts: automate server setup or deployment
- Git automation: commits, branches, pull requests

Exercises:
- Automate common shell commands.
- Monitor server resources and log them.
- Automate Docker container builds and management.

Mini-Project:
- Server health monitor: Check CPU/memory/disk, log to a file, send alerts if thresholds exceeded.
- Automated deployment script: Deploy a simple web app to a local server with one command.

Phase 4: Real-Life Projects & Integration (Weeks 11–14)
--------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Apply Python automation in integrated, practical projects.

Project Ideas:
1. Personal DevOps pipeline: pull code from Git, build Docker containers, run tests, deploy.
2. Web scraper + notifier: scrape product prices/news and send email/SMS notifications.
3. Log analyzer: parse server logs, summarize errors, generate reports automatically.

Exercises:
- Write modular scripts with reusable functions and classes.
- Combine multiple scripts to create an automated workflow.

Phase 5: Polish & Expand (Weeks 15–18)
--------------------------------------
Goal: Refine code quality, testing, and explore optional advanced topics.

Focus Areas:
- Unit testing (pytest) for automation scripts
- Packaging and distributing Python scripts (setup.py, pip installable)
- Virtual environments and dependency management (venv, pip, requirements.txt)
- Optional: async Python (asyncio) for faster network scripts
- Optional: cloud integration (AWS S3, APIs, serverless functions)

Mini-Project:
- Package one of your automation scripts as a reusable tool.
- Write tests for your scripts to ensure reliability.

Additional Tips:
- Daily: 30–60 min exercises or mini-tasks.
- Weekly: 1 mini-project integrating what you learned.
- Use GitHub to store exercises and projects. Document progress in README.
- By the end of 3–6 months, you’ll have a portfolio of Python scripts automating tasks + DevOps projects.
