# Python Programming MOOC 2024 - Completion Summary

This repository contains my completed exercises from the **Python Programming MOOC 2024** offered by the University of Helsinki (MOOC.fi). The exercises cover both the Introduction and Advanced course sections.

## Course Overview

### Introduction to Programming
- **Part 1:** Basics of Python, variables, simple expressions  
- **Part 2:** Input, output, and conditional statements  
- **Part 3:** Loops and basic problem solving  
- **Part 4:** Functions and modular coding  
- **Part 5:** Strings and lists  
- **Part 6:** Dictionaries, sets, and file I/O  
- **Part 7:** Recursion and more advanced data structures  

### Advanced Programming
- **Part 8:** Object-oriented programming - classes, methods, and inheritance  
- **Part 9:** Advanced functions and Python features  
- **Part 10:** Algorithms and problem solving with OOP  
- **Part 11:** More advanced data structures and handling  
- **Part 12:** Project exercises (small games, simulations)  
- **Part 13:** GUI and event-driven programming  
- **Part 14:** Final projects (larger games, Sokoban, Space Shooter, etc.)

## Personal Progress Highlights
- Completed all exercises up to Part 14.
- Implemented several game projects:
  - **Space Shooter**: A top-down shooting game with enemies, bullets, and scoring. Polygons for sprites were AI-generated.
  - **Sokoban**: Classic box-pushing puzzle game with images for tiles and player.
- Explored Python features including:
  - Recursion, classes, object-oriented programming
  - Event handling with `pygame`
  - List comprehensions and game loops
  - Collision detection and simple physics
- Used proper reset mechanisms, cooldowns, and state management for game flow.
- Focused on practical implementations rather than graphical design.

## Notes
- The course material and exercises are provided by [MOOC.fi](https://programming-24.mooc.fi/all-exercises)
- This repository serves as both a learning record and showcase of Python programming exercises.
