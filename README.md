# Python Learning Repository

This repository contains my Python exercises and projects from the **MOOC 2024 Python course** (MOOC.fi).  
It tracks my progress from beginner exercises to advanced topics, including object-oriented programming, recursion, and game development with `pygame`.

See the **[Completion Summary](Completion_Summary.md)** for a detailed overview of the course parts and personal progress highlights.
