This program models persons and a BabyCentre that can weigh and feed them.

Classes:
- Person: stores a person's name, age, height, and weight.
- BabyCentre: performs actions on Person objects.
  • weigh(person): returns the person's weight and counts the weigh-in.
  • feed(person): increases the person's weight by 1.
  • weigh_ins(): returns the total number of weigh-ins performed.

Example usage:
Create Person objects, feed them, weigh them, and track the number of weigh-ins.
